# 002 Add Two Numbers

-   The first attempt is okay with small numbers but fails with large numbers with JS/TS
-   Instead of a bunch of weird processes like converting to string, concatenating, changing back to a number, adding the numbers, and then reversing the order, it was best to "add as we go" and take note of the carry amount.
-   There's still room for improvement. Maybe revisit when I get more better.
